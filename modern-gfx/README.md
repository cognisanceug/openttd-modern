# Modern Terrain – 32bpp graphics for OpenTTD

A NewGRF that replaces OpenGFX sprites with 32bpp graphics rendered in Blender,
in the style of the "Schienenwerk" map study: isometric low-poly look, soft
light without hard shadows. Gameplay is unchanged. Licence: GPL v2.

Currently covered (temperate):

| Sprites   | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| 3924–4060 | ground: bare soil, 1/3 and 2/3 grass, grass, rough land (+4 flat variants), two rocky sets |
| 4061      | open water (sea, lakes, canals) |
| Action 5 `COAST_TILES_DIAGONAL` | all 18 shore shapes: water, foam line, beach, meadow by height |
| `FEAT_CANALS` `WF_RIVER_SLOPE`, `WF_RIVERBANKS` | rivers: flat water + 4 slopes, and 60 bank pieces (sides, outer/inner corners, flat and sloped); our own definitions replace OpenGFX's |
| Action 5 `OVERLAY_ROCKS` 95–113 | rocks on water and coast |
| 990–1003, Action 5 `FOUNDATIONS_SLOPES_HALFTILES` | all foundations: leveled, inclined, halftile; stone walls, coping on back edges |
| 1005–1036 | rails: straight, short pieces, cross, junction grounds and single overlays, 12 slopes, double pieces |
| 1301–1308 | track fences: low-poly post-and-rail, flat, diagonal and sloped |
| 1313–1350 | roads with pavements (towns) and with grass verges: 19 shapes each incl. slopes and dead ends |
| 1370–1381 | level crossings, open and barred |
| 1576–1715 | all 20 temperate tree bases × 7 growth stages (17 species; 0x6AD repeats the spruce like OpenGFX) |

Every sprite ships as 8bpp fallback plus 32bpp at 1x, 2x and 4x.

## Camera calibration

`blender/ottd_camera.py` holds the projection: orthographic, 30° elevation,
45° azimuth, one tile = 1 Blender unit, one height level = 1/(2√6) ≈ 0.2041.
A flat tile is then 64z × 32z px and, sampled at pixel centres, covers
31/63/127 rows – 256×127 at 4x. Slope triangulation follows
`GetPartialPixelZ()`: the fold runs along the diagonal whose corners are level.

`tools/check_calibration.py` verifies every rendered footprint against the
analytic projection (must be 0 px off) and the OpenGFX sprite boxes. At 1x a
few edge pixels differ from OpenGFX, where the original was rounded by hand.

## Pipeline

Requires Blender 4.5 (`brew install --cask blender`) and NML in a venv:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install nml numpy
B=/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender

# reference data from OpenGFX (offsets, sizes, masks)
tar -xf ~/Documents/OpenTTD/baseset/opengfx-8.0.tar -C ref
.venv/bin/python tools/grf_extract.py ref/opengfx-8.0/ogfx1_base.grf 3924 4060 ref/ground
.venv/bin/python tools/grf_extract.py ref/opengfx-8.0/ogfx1_base.grf 1576 1715 ref/trees

# textures, renders, checks, GRF
.venv/bin/python tools/make_ground_textures.py render/textures
.venv/bin/python tools/make_infra_textures.py render/textures render/textures/infra   # needs numpy
$B -b --factory-startup -P blender/render_ground.py -- render/ground
$B -b --factory-startup -P blender/render_trees.py -- render/trees
$B -b --factory-startup -P blender/render_foundations.py -- render/foundations
$B -b --factory-startup -P blender/render_fences.py -- render/fences
.venv/bin/python tools/check_calibration.py render/ground ref/ground
.venv/bin/python tools/pack_grf.py render/ground ref/ground render/trees render/foundations render/fences nml
```

The result is `nml/modern_terrain.grf`. To check it in game without touching
your own OpenTTD config (needs the game built in `../build`):

```sh
SEED=5 tools/ingame_shot.sh modern trees_4x       # -> shots/trees_4x.png
SEED=1 tools/ingame_shot.sh modern rocks_4x keep  # leaves the window open
SEED=2 tools/ingame_shot.sh water coast_4x        # high sea level: coast and coast rocks
SEED=2 tools/ingame_shot.sh town town_4x          # many towns: foundations, and a river
SEED=1 tools/infra_shot.sh infra_4x               # InfraTest game script builds rails, roads, crossings
```

## Style

`blender/style.py` reproduces the map study's lighting: base colour times
`clamp(1 + gain·(N·L/L.z − 1), lo, hi)`, light from the study's direction.
Ground textures repeat exactly once per tile so neighbouring tiles join
seamlessly. Shore tiles are coloured by height on the tile (water below 0.05
levels, then foam, wet sand, beach, meadow), so they meet open water and grass
without a seam. Water is static; OpenTTD's palette animation is not used.
Scatter objects (tufts, boulders) are real geometry placed on the slope
surface and cut to the tile outline by the footprint mask. Rails and roads
are drawn as tile-space textures (tools/make_infra_textures.py: ballast,
sleepers, rails; asphalt, kerbs, lane markings) and laid on the flat or
sloped tile in Blender, so slopes and tile joins stay exact.
